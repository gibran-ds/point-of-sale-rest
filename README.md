# point-of-sale-rest
Simple Point of Sale Rest API with GraphQL support. It is writed with Spring Boot + Hibernate, and also uses a MySQL to data storage.

To Run, I highly recommend you IntelliJ Idea Community Edition. It includes a great support to Maven build in scripts.

Before run you need to install JDK, Java IDE and MySQL Server with default configurations.
